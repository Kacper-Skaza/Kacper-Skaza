- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kacper-Skaza

I am a second-year computer science student with a passion for programming and technology. My solid theoretical foundation was obtained at university, complemented by practical skills gained from creating my own projects. Proficient in programming languages such as C++, C#, C, Python, HTML, and CSS, I have also used game development software like Unity. Eager to learn and dedicated, I am ready for new challenges in the IT industry. Seeking my first professional experiences, I aim to develop my skills further and contribute to my professional growth.
